lineage_params:
  floor: 3 #minimum score value. Set higher to filter smaller and less valuable proposals. Set to 0 to report any and all sublineage proposals that pass other filters.
  annotation: B.1.1.529 #consider only this lineage and its descendents for sublineage proposal. Set to None to consider all lineages. 
  missense: True #consider only mutations that lead to amino acid changes as part of the haplotype. 
  gene: None #consider only mutations within the indicated gene as part of the haplotype. Set to None to use the whole genome.
  minsamples: 10 #minimum sample weight. Default weighting scheme is 1 per sample (more for underrepresented countries when country_weighting is used).
  distinction: 1 #minimum mutation weight. Default weighting scheme is 1 per mutation (more for mutations associated with immune escape if escape_weighting is used).
  recursive: False #allow proposal of additional sublineages from newly proposed lineages. Can break links for recursively proposed lineage issue output.
  cutoff: 0.99 #stop adding new serial (exclusive) lineage annotations when this percentage of samples is labeled.
  earliest_date: '2022-10-15' #ignore all samples before this date. Set to 2019-12-01 to examine the entire pandemic.
  weight_params:
    escape_weighting: 0 #Higher values means mutations associated with immune escape by the Bloom lab DMS are given higher weight. Set to 0 to disable escape weighting. 
    country_weighting: 10 #Higher values means samples from underrepresented countries count more. Set to 0 to disable country weighting. 
reporting_params:
  sort_by: "proposed_sublineage_score" #sort the results by this column.
  number: 20 #report the top X lineages in issues.
  prefix: "proposed_" #set a prefix for markdown and associated file output.
  samples_named: 15 #name up to this many samples within the text of the report, including the oldest and youngest samples. 
  local_only: True #set to True to print markdown issues to local files instead of attempting to post them to the repository issues board.
request_params:
  designation_repo: "./auto-pango-designation" #path to a local clone of https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation or one of its forks. Required for pull request generation.
  local_only: True #update local files and print the text for a pull request body to a local markdown file instead of opening a branch and pull request on the targeted repository.
  auto_merge: False #immediately merge the generated pull request, if your api_key has permissions.
  representative_number: 1000 #add up to this many lineage representative samples per lineage to lineages.csv.
  valid_samples: "None" #use samples from this file when expanding lineages.csv. Set to "None" to use any samples from the tree.
  countries: 1 #set a minimum number of countries a lineage must exist in to be included in the request.
  maximum: 20 #set a maximum number of lineages to include in a pull request. The top N are sorted by stratified growth.
  growth: 0.005 #set a minimum mean stratified proportional weekly periodic growth. 0.01 means that, on average, the lineage grows to consist of 1% more of all the collected samples in each country its in each week.
  active_since: '2022-12-01' #only include lineage proposals that were actively sampled since the indicated date. Set to "None" to report all.
