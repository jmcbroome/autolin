lineage_params:
  floor: 100 #minimum score value. Set higher to filter smaller and less valuable proposals. Set to 0 to report any and all sublineage proposals that pass other filters.
  annotation: B.1.1.529 #consider only this lineage and its descendents for sublineage proposal. Set to None to consider all lineages. 
  missense: True #consider only mutations that lead to amino acid changes as part of the haplotype. 
  gene: S #consider only mutations within the indicated gene as part of the haplotype. Set to None to use the whole genome.
  minsamples: 15 #minimum sample weight. Default weighting scheme is 1 per sample (more for underrepresented countries when country_weighting is used).
  distinction: 1 #minimum mutation weight. Default weighting scheme is 1 per mutation (more for mutations associated with immune escape if escape_weighting is used).
  recursive: True #allow proposal of additional sublineages from newly proposed lineages. 
  cutoff: 0.99 #stop adding new serial (exclusive) lineage annotations when this percentage of samples is labeled.
  earliest_date: '2022-06-30' #ignore all samples before this date. Set to 2019-12-01 to examine the entire pandemic.
  weight_params:
    escape_weighting: 100 #Higher values means mutations associated with immune escape by the Bloom lab DMS are given higher weight. Set to 0 to disable escape weighting. 
    country_weighting: 10 #Higher values means samples from underrepresented countries count more. Set to 0 to disable country weighting.

  json_size: 4000 #output jsons will include at most this many samples.
